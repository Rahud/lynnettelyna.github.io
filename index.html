        <p class="para">Fashion is one the most trending in the world. I am a Fashion fan, fashion is good. <br> We need to show our love for fashion. "How?" someone may ask and I recommend my answer to be; "in any way you want, it can be clothing, hair, decoration or behaviour as long as it's corresponding to fashion." <br> Many people are still confused of fashion as they take it to be something for granted. In my world I take fashion to be part of my life and my cosmic friend. Fashion can be termed as a popular or the latest style of clothing, hair, decoration, or behaviour. It is most in the teenagers and other slay queens as it is said by many people. Fashion obviously is not something easy to maintain since all fashionistas need to be alert of the new fashions. I personally came up with this web blog to show you my fashion experience. So please enjoy the goodness of my web blog.</p>
